# Simple 2d JS NavMesh

I needed a 2D navmesh system for a project I was working on, but it turned out this was more interesting than the original project. Here's a [demo](https://felixmo42.github.io/nav/build).

The hope is that it can function both as a navmesh library for those who want one, as well as an explainer of the algorithms behind it.

> Note: [Mike Hadley's navmesh](https://github.com/mikewesthad/navmesh)  is the best library I know of. The main limitation is that it doesn't work for non-grid-based maps.
